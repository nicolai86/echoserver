# echoserver

A simple echo server implementation with Clojure.

## Usage

The project is managed with [lein][1]. Assuming you've got lein installed all you need to do is to clone the project locally and execute `lein run`

You'll be welcome with a simple "Hello World" message.

Now run `telnet localhost 8080` and echo away :)

## The Why

I'm learning clojure and I'd like to write a simple threaded move-based game server in clojure. This is a first step for me, playing with clojure & java interoperability.
